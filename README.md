## My process

- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the second Frontend Mentor challenge that I completed. The aims were to practice vertical and horizontal centering, BEM naming of CSS classes, and CSS grid. I did these reasonably well and received excellent feedback. Later, with more experience I returned to this and made improvements. One significant change was dropping grid for flexbox, which makes more sense for this simple element.
